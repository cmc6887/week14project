            For this project, I used Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, and Brackets. I used my prior Photoshop experience to aid my websites looks. When working on this project I learned quite a few things. I first learned how to use Adobe Illustrator, in order to make the SVG graphics used on my pages. I also learned a lot about JavaScript. I learned one way how to use a timer. I learned how to and the uses of running multiple of the same function at the same time. I learned how to move divs to different locations based on the screen resolution, and or the window size. I also learned how to repeat functions through a timer. I even learned some more funky css transitions such as a blur effect. For this project I went above and beyond on the both the layout and functionalities for these pages. For each page I made very different mini games all with a central theme but all very different and they even have a practical use! I went above and beyond for each pages functionalities, adding start buttons to two pages and adding high scores to two pages as well. I went above and beyond learning new features never talked about in this class for JavaScript, such as the ones I learned from this project. I also went above and beyond making the backgrounds for each page, and making the menu icons for the landing page. Those pictures took me quite a while, especially the silhouette ones based off real counterstrike maps. There were two main resources I used throughout this project. The first one was a W3school tutorial, https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_js_countdown . This tutorial was really helpful to me as I used it as a resource to help me understand how time worked and was used throughout almost every page I made. The other tutorial I relied on a lot was https://codepen.io/cliff538/pen/Eslxr . Just by seeing one way a reaction test was done, it helped me tremendously as I was able to expand that into 3 completely different pages. The most proud page I made was the aim training one. For this page I couldnâ€™t figure out why the game kept getting harder the higher the score I got. Then I found out it was because I just call a method a lot that makes the game harder the longer you play, so once I figured it out,I just kept it in because I thought it would be fun.
