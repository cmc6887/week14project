# week14project
PROPOSAL:

I plan on making a Counter Strike Themed website. The landing page will be simple have short descriptions of the each of the features on it and show some counter strike graphics. This website will have 3 different features on it, all on different pages. Each page will also have the skylines of different maps that I made up with different color schemes, however I currently have only made one. The purpose of this page is to be fun, and make you better at the game without playing it.

 The first feature is a reaction test. Reaction Tests are good for warming up your reflexes when not playing the game. This reaction test will basically be a yellow dot, when clicked will turn it to a red dot, and then it will randomly turn green, when turning green you click it to see how long it takes for you to click it off. Here is a mockup of the screen.
 

The second page will be a rapid fire test, exercising your trigger finger. This one will measure how many times the you click the dot in the center in a 10 second span.  There will also be a big countdown timer for this one at the top. After the timer goes off, it will say how many times you clicked. Here is a mockup of the screen.
 






The last page will be a target practice, aim training page. On this page the user just clicked the targets when they spawn randomly on certain locations every second. 


 
The Libraries I plan on using are http://animejs.com, Animate.css, I plan on using SVG graphics for the targets and dots. I know what SVG graphics are, but donâ€™t really know how to manipulate them, I am also going to learn how to use the time function within JavaScript and learn how it works since all 3 of my pages will use them.
